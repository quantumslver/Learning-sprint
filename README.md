# Learning Sprint — Cold Atom Python + LaTeX Prep

This repo is part of a daily sprint (16–30 June 2025) to build core coding skills for Cold Atom PhD research.  
Goal: become fluent in Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy) and LaTeX — no excuses, no delays.

---

## 📅 Day 1 — 16 June 2025

### ✅ Task
- Plot basic **projectile motion** using Python
- Learn how to use `matplotlib` for plotting
- Set up Git & GitHub with SSH
- Push working code to live repo

### 📓 Physics
Equation used:  
\[
y(t) = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
\]

Where:
- `u`: initial velocity (user input)
- `a`: acceleration (gravity = –9.8 m/s²)
- `t`: time vector using `np.linspace`
- `y`: vertical position

### ⚠️ Struggles + Fixes
| Problem | How I fixed it |
|--------|----------------|
| Didn’t know how to start coding | Googled syntax + asked ChatGPT |
| `input()` gave string errors | Wrapped it in `float(input(...))` |
| Plot wasn’t showing points | Used `'rx'` to show red dots |
| Git setup was a nightmare | Finally got SSH key working, pushed repo |

### 🧠 Reflection
> Didn’t know shit about Python or Git.  
> But still finished the task, made a working plot, committed it, and pushed it live.  
> Not fast, not clean — but DONE.

## 🔮 Coming Up

- [ ] Day 2: NumPy vector ops + converting sim to full array math
- [ ] Day 3: Matplotlib styling + RK4 simulation
- [ ] More physics-based Python projects

## ⚔️ Motivation

> I'm not a CS guy. I'm a physics student with no background.  
> But I will build real tools for research — and I’ll leave all excuses behind.


## 📅 17-06-2025 — Day 2 (Lite Sprint)

### ✅ Task:
- [x] Rewrite projectile sim using arrays and vectorized math

---

### 🧠 NumPy Basics Learned
- Imported using `import numpy as np`
- Arrays created via: `a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])`
- Indexing is 0-based: `a[2]` returns `3`
- Slicing: `a[:3]` gives `array([1, 2, 3])`
- For 2D arrays: `a[n, m]` → `n = row`, `m = column`

#### 🔍 Array attributes:
- `a.ndim` → tells number of dimensions
- `a.shape` → [*TO DO tomorrow*] didn’t get to it yet

---

### 🧠 Realization of the Day
At first, I thought vectorizing this code was pointless. I was like:
> "Why the hell am I doing this again?"

Then I realized:  
The code I wrote **yesterday** was already vectorized.  
I was using `t = np.linspace(...)`, and the whole equation worked on arrays directly.

Turns out ChatGPT set me up to understand this on my own.  
That hit harder than any syntax lesson.

---

### ⚠️ Notes
- No LaTeX today either — ran out of time
- Didn’t do multi‑u plots or for-loops — will stack that with Day 3
- Will finish NumPy attributes + play with shapes in next sprint
